AI: Crossplane is an open source multi-cloud Kubernetes-native resource orchestrator. It can be used to deploy and manage database services, including those hosted on cloud provider services.

To add a database to the Kubernetes cluster using Crossplane, you will need to do the following:

1. First, determine which type of database you would like to add to the cluster. Popular database technologies include PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB.

2. Once you have selected a database type, create a YAML configuration file for it using the Crossplane CLI. This configuration file will specify the settings for the database.

3. Next, apply the YAML configuration file to the Kubernetes cluster.

4. The database should now be deployed and available for use. You can use the Crossplane CLI to manage and monitor the database.

Adding a database to a Kubernetes cluster with Crossplane is a straightforward process. By following the steps above, you should have no trouble getting started.
